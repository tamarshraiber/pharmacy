The project is an interface for managing pharmacies.
Anyone interested can create a pharmacy.

To create a pharmacy, need to enter basic data such as a name, amount of pharmacist stations, a default password for the pharmacist, etc.

The manager (who created the pharmacy) can:
add and delete pharmacists in his pharmacy,
update data,
open the user interface where users receive numbers for the queue (regular queue and special queue),
open the interface to view the queue status
and can also reset the queue at any given moment.

A pharmacist can update the default password, and enter a available position, and pop numbers from the queue.
